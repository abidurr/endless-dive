snappechat Un album délicat et riche en émotions et en ambiances. Merci de me redonner foi en la scène musicale wallonne. Favorite track: Atoms.

robert dykens Highlighting what made alternative and pop punk enjoyable in the late 90s and early 00s, Endless Dive has put together one of my favorite EPs of all time. Somber, aggressive and anthematic, the only shame is that it's on the short side. Regardless it's nice to hear thought, complexity and attention to detail put into this surprisingly seamless blend of punk and post-rock. Favorite track: Atoms.

maddew Emotional song that make me warm inside. Favorite track: Atoms.

ahduh this just makes me feel like i'm in a different place in a different time every time I listen to it. so good Favorite track: Atoms.

divinginthewaters I really cant deside, which one is my favourite track. Everything gives me so much hope. I love this, for beiing a part of my life and helping me through it. Thank you, Endless Dive. Favorite track: Gravity Always Wins.

Vanilka Jantarovic Their creation is full of emotions...
I love the endlessness and the sedateness... and I love whales ❤ Favorite track: Atoms.

jentl It's the kind of music that makes you stop dead in your tracks and just listen. Favorite track: Lifthome.

Julian Smolka The album is already worth it just for Gravity Always Wins alone. Favorite track: Gravity Always Wins.

Ben Leathley Great release from yet another good Belgian post-rock band; Belgium and post-rock seem to really go hand in hand. Poppier and 'happier' than most post-rock with a cinematic feel.
